# E-COMMERCE-PROGRAM
I have used javafx to implement the customer end of a e-commerce website.I have implemented both front end and back end.I have given option to view the available items according to seller id or cost.Customers can buy multiple items by putting in a cart.They can view their previous orders.The products table, cart table and deliveries table gets updated in the back-end.The deliveries table randomly assigns the 15 delivery guys to the purchased items.
Role of Cart,Products and Deliveries table-:
1)Cart-:The cart table has all details of all the items bought so far by all the customers.
2)Products-:The products table have information for all the available products.
3)Deliveries-:The deliveries table assigns a delivery guy to the orders placed by customer.
